# ImageJ macro scripts for puncta quantification

</br>
</br>
 
Here, we publish versions of the original ImageJ Macros (IJMs) custom-tailored for specific experiments in our projects. Some IJMs are accompanied by dedicated R scripts for further data analysis. We publish these scripts for sake of transparency, reproducibility, and as a potential resource for the academic community.
</br> </br> **Instructions for each script version are provided in the dedicated subfolders. For questions, please contact Alyona.** </br> </br> **Please cite our work when using these scripts in your research.**
