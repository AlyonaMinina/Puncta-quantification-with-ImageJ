 
Welcome to the IJM for puncta quantification in two fluorescent channels!
 
2  '.czi' images were detected for analysis
 The analysis is performed using 
 Prominence value for Ch1 = 40 and for Ch2 = 30
 Gaussian blur value for Ch1 = 0.07 and for Ch2 = 0.07
 Colocalization threshold = 0.5 um
 
 
Processing image 1 out of 2:
1_1.czi
3 ROIs will be analyzed for this image
Processing image 2 out of 2:
1_2.czi
3 ROIs will be analyzed for this image
 
All Done!
