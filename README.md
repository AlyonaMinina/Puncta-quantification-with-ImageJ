# ImageJ macro scripts for puncta quantification

</br>
</br>
 
Here, we publish versions of ImageJ Macros (IJMs) custom-tailored for specific experiments in our projects. Some IJMs are accompanied by dedicated R scripts for further data analysis. We publish these scripts for sake of transparency, reproducibility, and as a potential resource for the academic community.
</br> </br> **Instructions for each script version are provided in the dedicated subfolders. For questions, please contact Alyona.** </br> </br> **Please cite our GitHub repsoitories and our related publications when using these scripts in your research.**
</br>

These short scripts are designed to aid semi-automated puncta quantification on .czi (Carl Zeiss Image) microscopy images or on .tif image files.
To use this macro for Leica microscopy images, please export them first as tifs. You can do it in bulk using the dedicated ImageJ macro  ["Processing Leica CLSM project file for vacFRAP.ijm"](https://github.com/AlyonaMinina/Connectivity-Index)

In our group we use such assay to count autophagosomes or autophagic bodies in plant cells.
The scripts can be also implemented to count organelles such as Golgi apparatus, TGN, MVBs, mitochondria, peroxisomes etc.

You can find here scripts to quantify puncta in a single or in two fluorescent channels.

Here is an example of how macro works for a single channel:
